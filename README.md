Web Productivity Tools:

This project is a collection of productivity tools developed for internal use, with the goal of optimizing and streamlining our team's daily tasks. Built entirely with front-end technologies, this project showcases the power and flexibility of pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without the use of external libraries or frameworks.

The tools included are:

1. Date Converter
A simple utility to convert dates between different formats, making it easier to manage information with deadlines and schedules.

2. Unix Timestamp Converter
Converts a Unix Timestamp into a human-readable date and time format. This tool is essential for analyzing logs and manipulating data that uses this format.

3. HTML Rule Generator
Creates HTML rule blocks, ready to be inserted into the help block sections of the dashboards we develop. This tool standardizes and simplifies the creation of internal documentation, ensuring consistency and clarity.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Structure and markup for all pages.

CSS: Styling and layout, ensuring a clear and intuitive interface.

JavaScript: The logic and functionality behind each tool, controlling conversions and content generation.
